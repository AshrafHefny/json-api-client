## [0.4.0] - 2018-01-16

### Changed

Refactored to use [php-http/httpplug](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/index.html) instead of Guzzle so the library doesn't depend on a specific http client implementation.

This does change how you customize the ServiceProvider, just include an adapter for the client you want to use and the library uses [autodiscovery](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/discovery.html) to find the correct [adapter/client](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients.html). It also uses a [MessageFactory](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/message/message-factory.html) for creating Requests and Response objects.

So for example, if you want to use Guzzle, just `composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter`, and all should be swell.

In order to have a working mock client for testing you now need to include [php-http/mock-client](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients/mock-client.html). Which is an easy way to mock requests.
